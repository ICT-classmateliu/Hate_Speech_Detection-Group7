## Overview
This project is a course project for *Natural Language Processing*.  The main requirements are summarized as follows:  
__Research topic:__ Hate speech is usually defined as any verbal, written or behavioral expression that targets individuals or groups based on their identities. In other words, it refers to speech that attacks, denigrates or incites hatred against others because of their religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, skin color, lineage, gender or other identity characteristics.  
__Key techniques:__ Hate speech detection is typically modeled as a sentiment or text classification task. The model can be trained on labeled text data to distinguish hate / offensive speech from normal speech, and then applied to new text.  
__Evaluation metrics:__ Accuracy, Precision, Recall.

__Note:__
